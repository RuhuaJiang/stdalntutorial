People in the field of bioinformatics or related field always need to handle some
alignment task. It is necessary to have an easy to use library to facilitate our
work. stdaln.c is that thing.


stdaln.c is provided in BWA source code, written by Heng Li.
It is well written, and efficient. It can achieve  both global
gaped alignment with banded strategy and the local alignment
with banded strategy.

main.c gives a example how to use that.
